# Mistral OCR 3

## Highlights

- Breakthrough performance: 74% overall win rate over Mistral OCR 2 on forms, scanned documents, complex tables, and handwriting.

- State-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming both enterprise document processing solutions as well as AI-native OCR solutions

- Now powers Document AI Playground in [Mistral AI Studio](https://console.mistral.ai/build/document-ai/ocr-playground), a simple drag-and-drop interface for parsing PDFs/images into clean text or structured JSON

- Major upgrade over Mistral OCR 2 in forms, handwritten content, low-quality scans, and tables

## Overview

Mistral OCR 3 is designed to extract text and embedded images from a wide range of documents with exceptional fidelity. It supports markdown output enriched with HTML-based table reconstruction, enabling downstream systems to understand not just document content, but also structure. As a much smaller model than most competitive solutions, it is available at an industry-leading price of $2 per 1,000 pages, with a 50% Batch-API discount, reducing the cost to $1 per 1,000 pages.

Developers can integrate the model (mistral-ocr-2512) via API, and users can leverage Document AI, a UI that parses documents into text or structured JSON instantly.

## Benchmarks

To raise the bar, we introduced more challenging internal benchmarks based on real business use-case examples from customers. We then evaluated several models across the domains highlighted below, comparing their outputs to ground truth using fuzzy-match metric for accuracy.

## Upgrades over previous generations of OCR models

Whereas most OCR solutions today specialize in specific document types, Mistral OCR 3 is designed to excel at processing the vast majority of document types in organizations and everyday settings.

- Handwriting: Mistral OCR accurately interprets cursive, mixed-content annotations, and handwritten text layered over printed forms.

- Forms: Improved detection of boxes, labels, handwritten entries, and dense layouts. Works well on invoices, receipts, compliance forms, government documents, and such.

- Scanned & complex documents: Significantly more robust to compression artifacts, skew, distortion, low DPI, and background noise.

- Complex tables: Reconstructs table structures with headers, merged cells, multi-row blocks, and column hierarchies. Outputs HTML table tags with colspan/rowspan to fully preserve layout.

Mistral OCR 3 is a significant upgrade across all languages and document form factors compared to Mistral OCR 2.

## Recommend use cases and applications

Mistral OCR 3 is ideal for both high-volume enterprise pipelines and interactive document workflows. Developers can use it for:

- Extracting text and images into markdown for downstream agents and knowledge systems

- Automated parsing of forms, invoices, and operational documents

- End-to-end document understanding pipelines

- Digitization of handwritten or historical documents

- Any other document → knowledge transformation applications.

Our early customers are using Mistral OCR 3 to process invoices into structured fields, digitize company archives, extract clean text from technical and scientific reports, and improve enterprise search.

“OCR remains foundational for enabling generative AI and agentic AI,” said Tim Law, IDC Director of Research for AI and Automation. “Those organizations that can efficiently and cost-effectively extract text and embedded images with high fidelity will unlock value and will gain a competitive advantage from their data by providing richer context.”

## Available today

Access the model either through the API or via the new Document AI Playground interface, both in [Mistral AI Studio](https://console.mistral.ai/build/document-ai/ocr-playground).
